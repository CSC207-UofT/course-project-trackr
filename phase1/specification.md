# Phase 1 Specification

An Android application that allows users to create, edit and save special events that they want to be reminded of. The app allows the user to specify the person who they want to associate the event with, and also specify the event as either an anniversary or birthday. Furthermore, the app will countdown the time until this event, and allows the user to provide a time interval for when they want to be reminded of the event. 

All of this information is displayed within the graphical user interface, which allows the user to view their events in a standard list or in a calendar. The user interface also provides the user with a simple way of adding or editing their upcoming events. Lastly, all of this information will be stored on a database, so the user can save this information, and access it at their convience.
