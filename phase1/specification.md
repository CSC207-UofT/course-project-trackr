## Trackr Phase 1 Specification

Trackr is an Android application that provides users with a simple way to create, edit, delete and save special upcoming events that they want to be reminded of.

Upon creating a new event, Trackr prompts the user to associate each event with a specific person and declare the event as either an anniversary or birthday. Furthermore, the app will ask the user for the date of this event, and the time interval for when the user wants to be reminded of the event. These events are then stored and provide the user with a way to track the time until they occur.

All of this information is displayed within the graphical user interface, fully equipped to allow users to simply manage and view all of their important events. This all happens on the homescreen, which provides a general outlook on all upcoming events, and connects the apps with various functionalities. This includes the ability to add, edit or delete specific events. The user interface also provides a dedicated calendar screen, providing the user with a structured overlook of all events in the near or distant future.

To increase the functionality of Trackr, the app is connected to a working notification system, so the user can receive the necessary reminder on their Android phone, at their desired time interval. Furthermore, all of these events are stored within a database, so the user can save their information, and access them at their convenience.
