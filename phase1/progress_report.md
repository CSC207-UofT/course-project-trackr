#  Progress Report

### Open Questions
- Open questions your group is struggling with  
  - How should we design the user experience in the future so that we can 
    allow multiple events to be tied with a certain person? How should the 
    user be able to choose which person is tied to which event?
  - Should we allow users to specify their own types of events or keep it
    only as birthdays and anniversaries? If the former, how should we 
    represent this (through inheritance or another TrackrEvent field)?
