## Trackr Phase 2 Specification

Trackr is an Android application that provides users with a simple way to create, edit, delete and save special upcoming events that they want to be reminded of.

Before storing an event, Trackr prompts the user to input the contact information for the person that they wish to associate an event with. This contact is then saved, and the user is then able to associate this person with as many events as they would like.

The events that are associated with people can take the form of either a birthday or anniversary and will be tied to the specific date of that event, recurring yearly. Furthermore, Trackr will count down the time until the date of that event and allows the user to choose the time interval for when they want to be reminded of the event.

Beyond adding people and events, Trackr allows the user to make any necessary modifications to either of the two. For instance, a persons first and last names, alongside the dates and time intervals for events are all customizable after being created. Lastly, the user has the option to delete a specific event or delete a person, which will subsequently delete all events associated with that person.

All of this information is displayed within the graphical user interface, fully equipped to allow users to simply manage and view all events and people. This all happens on the homescreen, which provides a general outlook on all upcoming events, and connects the apps with various functionalities. This includes the ability to add, edit or delete specific events or people. The user interface also provides a dedicated calendar screen, providing the user with a structured overlook of all events in the near or distant future.

To increase the functionality of Trackr, the app is connected to a working notification system, so the user can receive the necessary reminder on their Android phone, at their desired time interval. Furthermore, all of these events are stored within a database, so the user can save their information, and access it at their convenience.
