This is arguably the most important part of your project â€” even more important than the code itself! Phase 1 should have given your group a great start on this document, so you should just need to update it based on what you work on in phase 2. Take the time to polish it up and catch any typos, poor formatting, or missing content.

Reminder: Your TA will start by reading this document when they grade your project, so make a good first impression!

The document should include everything outlined in phase 1, except the progress report should contain:

- a brief summary of what each group member has been working on since phase 1
- Each group member should include a link to a significant pull request (or two if you can't pick just one) that they made throughout the term. Include a sentence or two explaining why you think this demonstrates a significant contribution to the team.
- *NEW* Please read A Suggested Development Workflow if you or your group has been having trouble with the idea of using branching and pull requests in your workflow.

Your group may choose to include other information in your design document, as you see fit. For example, you might include additional information about testing in your program and a summary of the test coverage. Including links to specific parts of the code or pull requests are strongly encouraged.

Remember to keep the document concise and focused
