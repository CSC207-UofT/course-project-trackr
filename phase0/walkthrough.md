# Scenario Walkthrough:

The user will get to choose what they want to do:

The user can create a birthday event:
The event will have a date and a friend it corresponds to. The user can also make personalized comments and set a time before the event to be notified. The program will store the event with its information (date, friend, set time). Once it has reached the time to be notified, the program will output a notification to the user about the birthday event and the friend it is for.

The user can look through their events and edit information:
The user will search for the event they want to see the details of. Then the program will show the user the details of the selected event. Then, the user can choose to edit the details (including removing the event). The program will update and store the changed details of the event (or remove it from its storage if that is what the user decided).
