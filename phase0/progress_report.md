# Progress Report 

### Part 1: Project Summary

#### Specification

Our reminder application allows users to create, edit, or delete events that correspond to the date of a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary.

#### CRC Model

Our CRC model has four **Entities** (Anniversary, Event, Birthday, Person), two **Use Cases** (Event Manager, Person Manager), one **Controller** (BirthdayPresenter), and two **Drivers** (Command Line Interface, Data Storage).

#### Scenario Walk-Through

Our typical walk-through has the user decide between creating a new event or managing previously set events. If they want to create an event, they need give it a name, date, associated person, and set time they want to be reminded before the event. If the user wants to view and edit their evetns, they can search through the events and have the option to change certain elements of that event or delete it entirley.

#### Skeleton Program

<ul>
  <li> Create new Birthday Events
