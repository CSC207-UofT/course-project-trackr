# Progress Report 

Prepare a short written document updating your TA on your group's progress so far. At your next meeting with your TA, your group should be ready to present a summary of your progress report to your TA. Each group member must present part of the progress report.

The report should include:
<ul>
  <li> a brief summary of your specification, CRC model, scenario walk-through, and skeleton program,
  <li> open questions your group is struggling with,
  <li> what has worked well so far with your design,
  <li> and a brief summary of what each group member has been working on and plans to work on next.
</ul>
