# Progress Report 

Prepare a short written document updating your TA on your group's progress so far. At your next meeting with your TA, your group should be ready to present a summary of your progress report to your TA. Each group member must present part of the progress report.

The report should include:
<ul>
  <li> a brief summary of your specification, CRC model, scenario walk-through, and skeleton program,
  <li> open questions your group is struggling with,
  <li> what has worked well so far with your design,
  <li> and a brief summary of what each group member has been working on and plans to work on next.
</ul>

### Part 1: Project Summary

#### Specification

Our reminder application allows users to create, edit, or delete events that correspond to the date of a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary.

#### CRC Model

Our CRC model has four **Entities** (Anniversary, Event, Birthday, Person), two **Use Cases** (Event Manager, Person Manager), one **Controller** (BirthdayPresenter), and two **Drivers** (Command Line Interface, Data Storage).

#### Scenario Walk-Through

Our typical walk-through has the user decide between creating a new event or managing previously set events. If they want to create an event, they need give it a name, date, associated person, and set time they want to be reminded before the event. If the user wants to view and edit their evetns, they can search through the events and have the option to change certain elements of that event or delete it entirley.

#### Skeleton Program

Our Skeleton Program will be able to do the following
<ul>
  <li> Create new Birthday Events
  <li> Create new Anniversary Events
  <li> More
</ul>
